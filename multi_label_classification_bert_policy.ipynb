            "Yet from that first moment, the Republican White House candidate has evaded questions when pressed for details. Now that he's a presumptive nominee with sliding poll numbers, his spokeswoman says he's no longer seeking the ban at all.\n",
            "In its place, he's offering an approach based on a standard of terrorism that he and his campaign refuse to define.\n",
            "The ban idea originated with 28 direct and forceful words, issued immediately after the December shootings in San Bernardino, California, that killed 14 people. The blanket nature of the proposal, which appeared to stretch beyond immigration to include any member of the Muslim faith seeking to cross the U.S. border, provoked a flurry of questions.\n",
            "The legal argument began when the FBI obtained a court order that would require Apple to bypass the password protection on one of the iPhones used by the shooters involved in the terrorist attack in San Bernardino, Calif., in December. The FBI says that it is seeking information on Syed Rizwan Farook's work phone to look for any connections to militant groups.\n",
            "Apple asked for the order to be vacated, arguing that writing new code for one phone would establish a difficult precedent for consumer privacy.\n",
            "Mr. Al Hussein joins leaders in the tech industry who have pledged their support to the Apple case. On Thursday, more than a dozen companies, including Facebook, Google, and Microsoft filed amicus briefs, or a form of outside comment, voicing their unity with Apple and their opposition to the US government's ongoing anti-encryption efforts. Privacy advocates such as the American Civil Liberties Union filed their own briefs earlier in the week.\n",
            "\"The government has defended its application as limited to this case and this case alone, but the legal precedent it seeks cannot be so contained. If the government prevails, then this case will be the first of many requiring companies to degrade the security and to undermine the trust in their products so essential to privacy in the digital age,\" the ACLU wrote in its argument.\n",
            "Some of the relatives of the San Bernardino attack victims also filed their own amicus briefs, in opposition to Apple. They wrote that because the government had a valid search warrant, Apple's argument about privacy is misdirected, as \"one does not enjoy the privacy to commit a crime.\" They also argued against Apple's argument that its computer code is a form of free speech that must be protected: \"This is the electronic equivalent of unlocking a door - no expression is involved at all,\" they said.\n",
            "Several law enforcement groups, including three in California and three at the federal level, also filed briefs that sided with the government.\n",
            "However, Salihin Kondoker, whose wife, Anies Kondoker, was injured in the December attacks, wrote a brief saying that he agreed with Apple's privacy concerns.\n",
            "\"When I first learned Apple was opposing the order I was frustrated that it would be yet another roadblock,\" he wrote. \"But as I read more about their case, I have come to understand their fight is for something much bigger than one phone. They are worried that this software the government wants them to use will be used against millions of other innocent people. I share their fear.\"\n",

While this has gone under the radar, HR departments play a pivotal role in preventing, mitigating, responding to and recovering from such tragedies. Most notable was the San Bernardino shooting, which involved a city employee who inspected city buildings. He and his wife killed his coworkers who were at an office party. It was HR writ large.\n",
            "The fight between Washington and Silicon Valley over access to a terrorist's smartphone is exposing law enforcement's long-simmering concerns over the challenges posed by encryption during investigations.\n",
            "Federal and local law-enforcement officials are increasingly voicing frustration with encrypted smartphones, which they say provide a haven for criminals and hinder investigations by keeping potentially valuable evidence out of reach.\n",
            "The battle over encrypted smartphones is part of a broader debate that dates back over a decade. Following the attacks on Sept. 11, 2001, Congress won broad support to pass the USA Patriot Act, which became the legal underpinning for roving wiretaps on terrorism suspects and bulk collection of phone records by the National Security Agency.\n",
            "Over time, however, concerns about privacy and civil liberties escalated, reaching an apex following the 2013 disclosures of government surveillance by former national-security contractor Edward Snowden. Last June, Congress approved a new bill called the USA Freedom Act, which curbed the government's spying powers and reined in the NSA's bulk collection.\n",
            "Moves by the telecom industry to address privacy concerns, especially the creation of stronger encryption on devices, have sparked outrage from law enforcement.\n",
            "\"There is not an investigation today at the local, state or federal level that doesn't touch a cyber platform,\" said Don Mihalek, who represents Secret Service members in the Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association. \"Encryption has made it impossible now for law enforcement to do their jobs.\"\n",
            "An effort to help defray local emergency costs connected to the San Bernardino mass shooting in 2015 was blocked by Gov. Jerry Brown on Sunday, with the governor citing the \"precedent\" the special help would create.\n",
            "Senate Bill 1385 would have allowed local law enforcement agencies to have more of their costs reimbursed from the Dec. 2, 2015, shooting. Fourteen people were killed in the attack at the Inland Regional Center in San Bernardino, with 22 others seriously injured.\n",
            "Law enforcement officers said the killers, Syed Rizwan Farook, 28, and his wife, Tashfeen Malik, 29, had been inspired by Islamic terrorists but had no direct ties to them.\n",
            "The cost of responding to the attack topped $18 million for local agencies, and SB 1385 sought to boost the level of reimbursement the state would have provided -- from 75% of eligible costs to 100% of those costs. Brown rejected the plan because of the risk that it would serve as a template for other incidents.\n",
            "Two months later, those bets have paid off. The stocks of Smith &Wesson and Sturm, Ruger spiked again after the San Bernardino, Calif., shootings last month. They also moved sharply in advance of President Obama's announcement on Tuesday of measures to curb gun violence.\n",
            "On Tuesday morning, Mr. Navellier appeared on the business television network CNBC and discussed his winning investment in gun makers.\n",
            "\"Mr. Obama is the best gun salesman on the planet,\" said Mr. Navellier, chairman of the Reno, Nev., investment firm Navellier &Associates, alluding to the notion that the White House's push for stricter gun laws has driven sharp increases in firearm sales.\n",
            "While the country reels from a series of mass shootings, each one reigniting the debate over the regulation of firearms, the hottest investments in the stock market seem to be shares of gun manufacturers.\n",
            "Since President Obama took office in 2009, shares of Smith &Wesson and Sturm, Ruger have each increased more than 900 percent, far surpassing the return of the Standard &Poor's 500-stock index (up 147 percent) and even outperforming the stock of Apple (up 800 percent).\n",
            "Many of the briefs observe that the debate over encryption and law enforcement needs should be addressed in Congress, which has heard testimony from Apple executives and top federal law enforcement officials over the past week.\n",
            "The brief filed by Twitter, Linkedin and others, including Reddit and Kickstarter, takes aim at the scope of the government's effort to secure Apple's help creating a \"backdoor\" to its own iPhone encryption.\n",
            "\"The government's demand, at its core, is unbound by any legal limits,\" the companies wrote. \"It would set a dangerous precedent, creating a world in which the government could simply force companies to create, design, and redesign their systems to allow law enforcement to access data.\"\n",
            "Several civil liberties organizations chimed in to oppose Justice Department efforts to force Apple to hack the iPhone of Syad Rizwan Farook, one of the shooters in the San Bernardino terror attack in December that left 14 people dead.\n",
            "Apple contends the request would threaten the privacy rights of tens of millions of consumers, while the government insists it is merely looking for technical aid to tap into the iPhone to search for clues in a crucial terrorism probe.\n",
            "But supporters of strict encryption protections say the request goes too far.\n",
            "\"This case concerns an unprecedented law-enforcement effort to conscript an American technology company into creating software designed to weaken the security of its own devices -- an effort that, if successful, would set precedent implicating the security and privacy of hundreds of millions of\n",
            "Americans,\" the ACLU wrote in its brief.\n",
            "In an interview published Tuesday morning with The Financial Times, the newspaper portrayed Mr. Gates as siding with the government in its attempt to force Apple to help investigators extract data from an iPhone that belonged to an attacker in the December mass shooting in San Bernardino, Calif.\n",
            "\"This is a specific case where the government is asking for access to information,\" Mr. Gates told the newspaper. \"They are not asking for some general thing, they are asking for a particular case.\"\n",
            "Later, speaking with Bloomberg News, he said the newspaper had gone too far in characterizing his allegiances.\n",
            "\"I do believe that with the right safeguards there are cases where the government, on our behalf, like stopping terrorism which could get worse in the future, that that is valuable,\" he said. \"But striking that balance -- clearly the government's taken information historically and used it in ways that we didn't expect going all the way back, say, to the F.B.I. under J. Edgar Hoover.\"\n",
            "The government is improperly relying on a 1789 federal law, the All Writs Act, to \"commandeer\" the company to hack the iPhone, threatening the privacy rights of anyone in the world with a smartphone.

The SCV plates feature the red battle flag crossed with a blue \"X\" and a license number that ends with \"CV.\" The plate issue is part of a movement to remove the Confederate battle flag from public squares and spaces in the wake of the killings of nine people in a church in Charleston, S.C. Images of the alleged shooter emerged quickly showing him displaying the battle flag.\n",

            "The vote comes after Southern lawmakers complained that they were sandbagged two nights ago when the House voted - without a recorded tally - to ban the display of Confederate flags at historic federal cemeteries and strengthen Park Service policy against its sale in gift shops.\n",
            "It's unclear how the vote will turn out, but momentum against the flag's display on public land has skyrocketed after last month's tragic slaughter at a historic black church in Charleston, South Carolina. Early Thursday, the state legislature finalized a bill to remove the flag from Statehouse grounds. Gov. Nikki Haley says she'll sign it Thursday afternoon. It must be removed 24 hours after her signature.\n",
            "There’s only one gun law that would make a difference: confiscation. Everything else is for show. And in this country, confiscation is impossible. Constitutionally, because of the Second Amendment. Politically, because doing so would cause something of an insurrection. And culturally, because Americans cherish — cling to, as Obama once had it — their guns as a symbol of freedom. \n",
            "The flag debate has been simmering since Memphis removed a huge granite marker to Forrest in January 2013 and since the city renamed three Confederate-themed parks in advance of a legislative vote to block the name changes.\n",
            "Republican state legislators subsequently filed The Tennessee Heritage Protection Act of 2013, but not before Confederate Park was changed to Memphis Park, Jefferson Davis Park to Mississippi River Park, and Nathan Bedford Forrest Park to Health Sciences Park.\n",

            "The Confederate flag debate, however, resurfaced after 21-year-old Dylan Storm Roof, the accused shooter of nine parishioners at historic Emanuel AME Church in Charleston, S.C., was seen in several photos waving the battle flag and burning the American flag in another.\n",
            "The Confederate flag has since caused a ripple of anti-sentiment and bitter discontent across America, particularly among African Americans, who are demanding the removal of all Civil War symbols from public places.\n",
            "Monuments honoring Confederate soldiers have been targeted for removal from courthouses, statehouses, schools and public parks since the racially motivated killings of nine African-American parishioners in 2015 at a church in Charleston, S.C., and after last year's violent protests at a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Va. Charlottesville leaders have voted to remove statues of Confederate Gens. Robert E. Lee and Thomas \"Stonewall\" Jackson. Earlier this year, Tulsa Public Schools removed a monument dedicated to Lee and rescinded the school's name. Meanwhile, the North Carolina Historical Commission is considering a formal request from late last year by Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper to move three monuments from the state's Capitol grounds to a historic battlefield site. But such statues and monuments aren't just being mothballed down South. Last year, Helena, Mont., removed a memorial to Confederate soldiers that had been in a public park since 1916. And in the Detroit suburb of Dearborn, a statue of former Mayor Orville Hubbard - who spent decades trying to keep the city all white - was socked away for more than a year after leaders decided it didn't belong outside a new City Hall. The Hubbard statue now stands beside a small museum. \n",

They strike me as quite reasonable and are consistent with the Second Amendment's protection of gun rights. We need to share these ideas with our leaders. Here they are:\n",
            "Impose universal background checks before buying a g u . n Twenty-two percent of gun purchases take place without a background check.\n",
            "Ban bump stocks, which allow semiautomatic rifles to fire more like automatics.\n",
            "Enforce a ban on possession of guns by anyone subject to a domestic violence protection order.\n",
            "Limit gun purchases by any one person to no more than, say, two a month, and tighten rules on straw purchasers who buy for criminals. Make serial numbers harder to remove.\n",
            "Adopt microstamping of cartridges so that they can be traced to the gun that fired them.\n",
            "Encourage the use of \"smart guns\" that use technology to limit their operation, such as not firing without a PIN, a fingerprint or a device nearby, like a special bracelet, so that children cannot misuse them. They would also be less vulnerable to theft.\n",
            "Require safe storage, to reduce theft, suicide and accidents by children.\n",
            "Invest in research to see what interventions will be more effective in reducing gun deaths, so we can base our policies on sound evidence.\n",
            "Maybe you would add a few other reforms, maybe modify a couple of his suggestions, or perhaps drop a couple of these ideas that you don't think are workable. Then write, call, and email our President, Senators and Representative, along with our Governor and our respective state Legislator and Senator.\n",
            "Gun owners don't agree on everything, either. Round and round we go, without resolution. There is truth on both sides, as well as manipulations of fact and contradictions to spare. All we know is that Vegas produced 58 premature funerals, and if we can't address that, well, what will it take? A body count of 100? 500? One of these in every congressional district in America (with the Vegas shooter reportedly also scouting Chicago)? Perhaps it's naive, but can't we work together on this? Our failure so far may be as much an indictment of America as the tragedies themselves.\n",
            "Eight days earlier, another tracking issue surfaced at Sunrise Hospital & Medical Center in Las Vegas - this one concerning incoming patients. The facility was suddenly inundated by people shot or otherwise injured during the tragedy at the outdoor country music festival; 212 patients were admitted in a two-hour window, 124 of them with gunshot wounds.\n",
            "Of those, 92 had no official photo identification on them.\n",
            "Families dashed desperately from one hospital to another searching for their loved ones, said Alan Keesee, the hospital's chief operations officer. Without IDs for patients, it was a challenge to confirm whether they were at the hospital, let alone whether they would be OK.\n",
            "Enterprising staffers listed their unidentified patients' physical traits and unique features, such as tattoos, to help match people with the descriptions family members provided. In turn, many relatives pulled up social media profile photos of their loved ones to give the hospital something to go by.\n",
            "The chaotic process of patient identification exposed a desperate need for a centralized data hub where descriptions of unidentified patients in a massive emergency could be uploaded and accessed by all area hospitals, Keesee said.\n",
            "And indeed, he said, his hospital is working with the Nevada Hospital Association and other local health agencies to determine whether the hub can be created.\n",
            "The Justice Department's proposed rule \"would define 'machine gun' to include bump-stock-type devices under federal law -- effectively banning them,\" Mr. Sessions said in a statement.\n",
            "The proposed bump stock ban would defy the conclusion of Justice Department officials who have said that they could not, under existing law, stop the sales of bump stocks, accessories that allow semiautomatic guns to mimic automatic fire, and that congressional action was needed to ban them. But Mr. Sessions said the department had worked around those concerns.\n",
            "\"After the senseless attack in Las Vegas,\" Mr. Sessions said, \"this proposed rule is a critical step in our effort to reduce the threat of gun violence that is in keeping with the Constitution and the laws passed by Congress.\" The 55-page proposal, which was published for public comment, said it was redefining machine guns to include bump stocks because \"such devices allow a shooter of a semiautomatic firearm to initiate a continuous firing cycle with a single pull of the trigger.\"\n",
            "The proposal would force bump stock owners to surrender or destroy them the day the rule would go into effect. A previous Justice Department review, done by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, was prompted by the mass shooting last fall in Las Vegas, where a gunman killed 58 people using semiautomatic weapons outfitted with bump stocks.\n",
            "Anyone with a smartphone won't have to make a call to report suspicious activity anymore, thanks to the launch of a security app.\n",
            "Gov. Nathan Deal announced the activation of \"See Something, Send Something,\" Wednesday in a news conference.\n",
            "\"(The app) allows citizens to report suspicious incidents and activities to the Georgia Information Sharing and Analysis Center,\" Deal said. \"There, analysts can evaluate, disseminate and request action from law enforcement agencies throughout our state if that becomes necessary.\"\n",
            "Georgia joins nine other states in using the app to allow individuals to send in tips and pictures of what they consider suspicious activity to law enforcement.\n",
            "While individuals can add location information when submitting a tip, Deal said the app does not allow officers to track their location.\n",
            "\"The application allows our agency to engage citizens without tracking their location or storing personal information,\" Deal said. \"Tips that are submitted are immediately removed from local devices.\"\n",
            "\"See Something, Send Something\" is not a substitute for 911, and emergencies should still be called in to the authorities, Deal said.\n",
            "Retired law enforcement officer Kevin Angell developed the app to make it easier for people to report suspicious or criminal activity, and named the app after the \"See something, say something\" campaign after the Las Vegas massacre last year, according to the app's website.\n",
            "The app is free for iPhone and Android users and can be downloaded from the App Store.\"\n",
            "After all, the controlling U.S. Supreme Court opinion in the Second Amendment is the Heller case in 2008, which found that Americans have a basic right to own a firearm for \"traditionally lawful purposes, such as self-defense within the home.\"\n",
            "That's not a blanket right to any weapon for any reason. The late Justice Antonin Scalia made that clear in his majority opinion.\n",
            "\"Like most rights, the right secured by the Second Amendment is not unlimited.\" It is \"not a right to keep and carry any weapon whatsoever in any manner whatsoever and for whatever purpose,\" Scalia wrote.\n",
            "\n",
            "﷯Page 2 of 3\n",
            "For a 'defensive' weapon, AR-15 sure is loved by mass killers\n",
            "You'd have a better argument at claiming the AR-15 is a protected weapon if you could show it being used in Scalia's \"self-defense within the home\" example. But it turns out handguns are much better for that. Far more common. And safer.\n",
            "And after combing through the online Nexis database, searching for stories that contained the words \"AR-15\" and \"homeowner\" and \"self-defense,\" it became pretty clear how fruitless this search was.\n",
            "AR-15s just aren't self-defense weapons. They're too big for concealed carry, too.\n",
            "As it turns out, the AR-15 is lousy at just about everything except killing a lot of people in a very short time, which was its original military mission. The main difference between the military M-16 and the AR-15 is that the military weapon has a fully automatic function, which allows multiple bullets to fire with one press of the trigger.\n",
            "This seems to be a distinction that barely matters, considering the amount of carnage that's still capable with the civilian version.\n",
            "The gun manufacturers have tried to recast this weapon as a \"sporting rifle\" or just \"America's rifle,\" in a ham-fisted stab at lethal patriotism.\n",
            "But if you look at the marketing of these weapons, it becomes clear that the target market is men who imagine themselves as warriors.\n",
            "The Freedom Group, a gun manufacturer that sells AR-15s, uses ads that show men dressed like Special Forces troops and brandishing weapons with slogans such as \"versatility on the range or during patrol.\"\n",
            "During patrol? What exactly is the objective of these patrols?\n",
            "Nikolas Cruz, the suspect in Wednesday's slaughter at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, is a troubled 19-year-old who displayed a fascination with violence, white supremacy and weapons on his social media postings.\n",
            "He went on patrol at his old high school this week.\n",
            "And he had the firepower to make it especially lethal -- firepower we ought not feel straitjacketed to defend.\n",
            "Fortunato said he expects some more centrist Republicans to join Democrats in voting for Frockt's bill if it reaches the floor. But Democrats still have to secure the votes of some pro-gun members of their own party.\n",
            "If the measure passes the Senate, the same dynamics will be at play in the House. Democrats control both chambers by narrow margins.\n",
            "So far this year, lawmakers have worked to pass some more modest gun regulations. Democrats are on the brink of banning \"bump stocks,\" a modification that can be used to make a semiautomatic rifle mimic a fully automatic \n",
            "To them, on both the substance and the politics, expanding background checks is the best approach. \"We do see that universal background checks work, they save lives,\" said Peter Ambler, executive director for American for Responsible Solutions, a gun-control group co-founded with former Democratic Rep. Gabby Giffords. \"That can be our North Star. We're going to do what works but not necessarily what feels good for ideologues on one side or the other.\" Ambler's group is not liberal or Democratic, but its approach to legislation carries enormous weight in the party. And its opinion on background checks is shared by other Democrats. \"I'm not suggesting there are no other policy suggestions worth pushing, but candidly, I think the notion that you're suggesting here that a registry of assault weapons would be a more radical or effective solution than universal background checks is a wrong or false premise,\" said Brian Kavanagh, a Democratic New York assemblyman and founder of the American State Legislators for Gun Violence Prevention\n"
